Collections
 - mutable data structure
 - can accept objects only
	ie: a collection of Integer Objects
 - thread-safe - can be used / accessed by multiple concurrent users
 - heavy weight

Arrays
 - immutable data structure
 - can accept both primitive values and objects
	ie: an array of int / an array of String / array of Employees
 - not thread safe
 - lightweight

Set
 - Unordered collection
 - unique

List
 - Ordered Collection
 - duplicates are permitted


Map

Iterator 
 - iteration is the process of retrieving each object inside a structure
 - Iterator can iterate forward	(List and Set)
 - ListIterator can iterate forward and backward (List only)

Generics
 - it provides a compile time safety feature


java.lang.Comparable vs java.util.Comparator
- 1 column sort		 - multiple column sort


Things to review before doing the Final Exercise
 - Exception Handling
 - GUI and Events
 - File IO / IO / File Serializing
 - Collection
